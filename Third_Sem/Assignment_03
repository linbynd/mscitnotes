(a) What is open source software? List the examples of open source
systems.?

Software is termed as an open source if you can download the software,
access its source code, and modify the source code. However, we have to
ensure that no license requirements are underestimated or overlooked. The
license terms differ drastically from software to software.
Some of the examples of open source systems are:
 Linux: It is a computer operating system and kernel originating as a
UNIX system and existing in many versions.
 Apache: It is a web server program used in most web server computers
and available for Windows as well as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Firefox: It is a web client program existing for Mac and Windows as well
as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Open office: It is an office application set, compatible with all other
major office application sets such as Microsoft Office and Mac as well as
Linux and other UNIX systems.

Before, we continue with the open source, let us understand the meaning of
closed source, which will give a clear idea about open source.
Closed source generally is not available for any changes. Source code is
not provided to the public. It is developed in an accumulated executable
state and this is what the market is authorised to access. For example,
Apple, the proprietor and developer of Macintosh operating systems, along
with other major software companies, have long been proponents of closed
source business.
On the other hand, open source software licenses are considered to be far
less restrictive in terms of how the software can be used. Fewer restrictions
do not mean that open source licenses will not impose any conditions on
usage.
The organization that opts for open source software will use the software the
way it desires. However, this freedom comes with certain responsibilities.
For example, if open source software users make some modification in the
source code of the software, it would be the users’ responsibility to share
the modifications made, with the actual developer of the product or the
software. It is also the responsibility of users to share the changes with the
user community/forum of the software. This principle enables to form a
network for information exchange and helps in optimising the product.
Open source software is distributed at zero cost and its source code is
available to the users at zero-price.
There are many reasons why open source software offer remarkable
benefits to users. It:
 Encourages innovation. Expensive software forces IT organizations to
purchase software only for proven applications. Lower costs allow
organizations to experiment and develop new applications or lines of
business and achieve greater business advantage.
 Enables IT organizations to minimize their software purchase budget
allocation, which in turn enables organizations to purchase software that
they might not have been able to afford.
 Increases the testability and robustness of the software, making it more
efficient and bug free. Since more users will use the software, they will
be able to find bugs and report them to the company and sometimes
provide possible solution to debug.

(b) What are the common tools required for the development of open
source software?
A program or an application the software developers use to create, debug,
and maintain new application is known as Software Development Tool.
These are small programs that provide a platform to develop the application,
test it and help to maintain it.
Depending on the function and the requirements, various application tools
are available in the market. Each tool has its own specifications and
features. Since these are open source tools, developers prefer to use these
tools to develop open source software.
Some of the common tools required for the development of open source
software are:
 Communication Tool.
 Software Engineering Tool.
 Bug Trackers and Task Lists.
 Testing Tools.
 Package Management.

Communication tool: Communication is an essential part of software
development. Usually developers and users of an open source project may
not be working in the same place. Some electronic means of communication
is required to establish a link between the developer and the user. E-mails
are the most common forms of communication among them. With the help
of an electronic mailing list (list of mail addresses stored in the hardware
memory) you can ensure that the e-mail messages are delivered to all
interested users at once.
Another important tool for communication is instant messaging. This
enables real time communication with the help of the internet. The Internet
Relay Chat (IRC) is an example of real-time internet text messaging or
chatting. It was designed mainly to address the need of group
communication in discussion forums. The most recent addition to electronic
communication is web forums. They have become a common way for users
to troubleshoot problems they encounter when using an open source
product. “Wikis” is one of the most popular web forums, the developers and
the users use.


Software engineering tool: Most of the volunteers who participate in the
development of OSS are distributed in different geographical regions of the
globe. This demands a need for tools to help developers to collaborate in
the development of source code.

Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is one of the prominent source code
collaboration tools used in OSS projects. When several people work on a
project at the same time, this tool helps to manage files and codes of the
project. This is achieved by moving the file into the users’ directories and
then merging the files when the users finish their work. It also enables you
to recover the previous version of a file stored in the directory.
The Subversion revision control system (SVN) is a successor of CVS. This
was developed to replace CVS. Though it is similar to CVS, it supports
some new versions of file formats and is compatible with many operating
systems.

Bug trackers and task lists: A bug tracker is a software application
designed to assist programmers to maintain quality in the design. It allows
the developer to keep track of bugs as and when they are found in the
product. It is also used as Issue Tracking System (ITS).
ITS is a software package that manages and maintains the list of issues in a
structured form, as needed by an organization. Irrespective of the size of the
organization, bug tracking system is very essential for efficient functioning of
a software development project. Some of the popular bug tracker softwares
are Bugzilla, Request tracker, Source Forge, and so on.
Testing tools: Any OSS development project frequently undergoes
integration. Integration is a process of arranging all small software
programmes and creating single software. For achieving efficient
integration, testing tools are used during the system integration for error
detection. Tinderbox is an example of one such testing tool. This tool
enables the developers in an OSS project to detect errors during the
integration of the system. The tool runs a continuous integration process
and informs users about the parts of source code that have problems. It also
provides information about the platform on which this problem has occurred.
The special feature of this tool is its ability to identify the author of the wrong
code during the integration process. Hence, the author is responsible for the 
error that can be traced and resolved. Since normal testing tools are very
expensive, open source testing tools are gaining popularity day by day.
A computer program used to find and reduce faults and errors in other
programs is known as a debugger. GNU Debugger (GDB) is an example of
debugger software used in Open Source Software development. This
debugger offers remote debugging.

For example, you have designed and modified some portion of the software.
A friend of yours who is in another part of the country would be able to
debug the software in your computer from his place. There is no need for
you to have debugging software installed in your computer for debugging
software. This feature makes it a special tool for open source software
development.
Memory leaks and buffer overflows can be detected using a programming
tool called a memory debugger. A memory leak occurs when a computer
program occupies unnecessary system memory. This problem happens
whenever a program fails to release memory that it has occupied after the
execution, which is no longer needed. Mozilla’s XPCOM is an example of
memory leak detection tool.
Package management: A collection of tools to automate the process of
installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing software packages from a
computer is known as Package Management System. The Red Hat
Package Manager (RPM) and Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) are package
management systems used by a number of Linux distributions. These tools
present a uniform way for users to install and remove programs with a single
command.
