1. (a) What is open source software? List the examples of open source
systems.?

Software is termed as an open source if you can download the software,
access its source code, and modify the source code. However, we have to
ensure that no license requirements are underestimated or overlooked. The
license terms differ drastically from software to software.
Some of the examples of open source systems are:
 Linux: It is a computer operating system and kernel originating as a
UNIX system and existing in many versions.
 Apache: It is a web server program used in most web server computers
and available for Windows as well as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Firefox: It is a web client program existing for Mac and Windows as well
as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Open office: It is an office application set, compatible with all other
major office application sets such as Microsoft Office and Mac as well as
Linux and other UNIX systems.

Before, we continue with the open source, let us understand the meaning of
closed source, which will give a clear idea about open source.
Closed source generally is not available for any changes. Source code is
not provided to the public. It is developed in an accumulated executable
state and this is what the market is authorised to access. For example,
Apple, the proprietor and developer of Macintosh operating systems, along
with other major software companies, have long been proponents of closed
source business.
On the other hand, open source software licenses are considered to be far
less restrictive in terms of how the software can be used. Fewer restrictions
do not mean that open source licenses will not impose any conditions on
usage.
The organization that opts for open source software will use the software the
way it desires. However, this freedom comes with certain responsibilities.
For example, if open source software users make some modification in the
source code of the software, it would be the users’ responsibility to share
the modifications made, with the actual developer of the product or the
software. It is also the responsibility of users to share the changes with the
user community/forum of the software. This principle enables to form a
network for information exchange and helps in optimising the product.
Open source software is distributed at zero cost and its source code is
available to the users at zero-price.
There are many reasons why open source software offer remarkable
benefits to users. It:
 Encourages innovation. Expensive software forces IT organizations to
purchase software only for proven applications. Lower costs allow
organizations to experiment and develop new applications or lines of
business and achieve greater business advantage.
 Enables IT organizations to minimize their software purchase budget
allocation, which in turn enables organizations to purchase software that
they might not have been able to afford.
 Increases the testability and robustness of the software, making it more
efficient and bug free. Since more users will use the software, they will
be able to find bugs and report them to the company and sometimes
provide possible solution to debug.

(b) What are the common tools required for the development of open
source software?
A program or an application the software developers use to create, debug,
and maintain new application is known as Software Development Tool.
These are small programs that provide a platform to develop the application,
test it and help to maintain it.
Depending on the function and the requirements, various application tools
are available in the market. Each tool has its own specifications and
features. Since these are open source tools, developers prefer to use these
tools to develop open source software.
Some of the common tools required for the development of open source
software are:
 Communication Tool.
 Software Engineering Tool.
 Bug Trackers and Task Lists.
 Testing Tools.
 Package Management.

Communication tool: Communication is an essential part of software
development. Usually developers and users of an open source project may
not be working in the same place. Some electronic means of communication
is required to establish a link between the developer and the user. E-mails
are the most common forms of communication among them. With the help
of an electronic mailing list (list of mail addresses stored in the hardware
memory) you can ensure that the e-mail messages are delivered to all
interested users at once.
Another important tool for communication is instant messaging. This
enables real time communication with the help of the internet. The Internet
Relay Chat (IRC) is an example of real-time internet text messaging or
chatting. It was designed mainly to address the need of group
communication in discussion forums. The most recent addition to electronic
communication is web forums. They have become a common way for users
to troubleshoot problems they encounter when using an open source
product. “Wikis” is one of the most popular web forums, the developers and
the users use.


Software engineering tool: Most of the volunteers who participate in the
development of OSS are distributed in different geographical regions of the
globe. This demands a need for tools to help developers to collaborate in
the development of source code.

Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is one of the prominent source code
collaboration tools used in OSS projects. When several people work on a
project at the same time, this tool helps to manage files and codes of the
project. This is achieved by moving the file into the users’ directories and
then merging the files when the users finish their work. It also enables you
to recover the previous version of a file stored in the directory.
The Subversion revision control system (SVN) is a successor of CVS. This
was developed to replace CVS. Though it is similar to CVS, it supports
some new versions of file formats and is compatible with many operating
systems.

Bug trackers and task lists: A bug tracker is a software application
designed to assist programmers to maintain quality in the design. It allows
the developer to keep track of bugs as and when they are found in the
product. It is also used as Issue Tracking System (ITS).
ITS is a software package that manages and maintains the list of issues in a
structured form, as needed by an organization. Irrespective of the size of the
organization, bug tracking system is very essential for efficient functioning of
a software development project. Some of the popular bug tracker softwares
are Bugzilla, Request tracker, Source Forge, and so on.
Testing tools: Any OSS development project frequently undergoes
integration. Integration is a process of arranging all small software
programmes and creating single software. For achieving efficient
integration, testing tools are used during the system integration for error
detection. Tinderbox is an example of one such testing tool. This tool
enables the developers in an OSS project to detect errors during the
integration of the system. The tool runs a continuous integration process
and informs users about the parts of source code that have problems. It also
provides information about the platform on which this problem has occurred.
The special feature of this tool is its ability to identify the author of the wrong
code during the integration process. Hence, the author is responsible for the 
error that can be traced and resolved. Since normal testing tools are very
expensive, open source testing tools are gaining popularity day by day.
A computer program used to find and reduce faults and errors in other
programs is known as a debugger. GNU Debugger (GDB) is an example of
debugger software used in Open Source Software development. This
debugger offers remote debugging.

For example, you have designed and modified some portion of the software.
A friend of yours who is in another part of the country would be able to
debug the software in your computer from his place. There is no need for
you to have debugging software installed in your computer for debugging
software. This feature makes it a special tool for open source software
development.
Memory leaks and buffer overflows can be detected using a programming
tool called a memory debugger. A memory leak occurs when a computer
program occupies unnecessary system memory. This problem happens
whenever a program fails to release memory that it has occupied after the
execution, which is no longer needed. Mozilla’s XPCOM is an example of
memory leak detection tool.
Package management: A collection of tools to automate the process of
installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing software packages from a
computer is known as Package Management System. The Red Hat
Package Manager (RPM) and Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) are package
management systems used by a number of Linux distributions. These tools
present a uniform way for users to install and remove programs with a single
command.

2. Explain the OSS licensing strategies

Open Source Software Licensing

As we have learnt about contract and copyright in the prevoius section. We will now discuss about open source software licensing, in this section. Before proceeding further we will firstly define, What is Open Source Software Licensing?

Open source software (OSS) licensing refers to licensing (granting permission to use intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents, or technology, under defined conditions) the software that is licensed to the users with the rights to execute the program for any reason, to transform the program, to reallocate duplications of either the original or transformed program (without royalties, etc).

Open source licensing is mainly advantageous when you want to prohibit an individual or group of users to completely utilize a work only for their own purpose. It also enables your work to reach a wide audience and also to have some commercial gain from such work. However, creators are required to surrender all the rights granted by copyright to the entities like the users of the work. These entities are capable of using the work of the creator and also distributing it according to the copyright law.

3.4.1 Types of OSS licenses

As we have already discussed about OSS licensing, so we will now discuss about the types of OSS Licenses, 

Types of OSS Licenses

 Copyleft licenses: Copyleft license refers to the license that tries to assure that the public keeps the rights to use, transform, and/or reallocate a creative work and all other works based on it, instead of restricting such rights. This license is used to keep up copyright conditions.

copy left licenses is also divided into different categories, which are as follows:

 Strong/weak copyleft license: Strong copyleft license refer to the license which is exercised to all inherited works. For example, GNU General Public License which consists of listing of all terms and conditions for duplicating, transforming, and allocating free software. Weak copyleft license refer to the license which is exercised only to the work that is copylefted, not to the remaining elements of the package. For example, Mozilla Public License acts as the controlling licensing for the Mozilla web browser and related software.

 Full/partial copyleft license: Full copyleft license remains when all parts of a work (except the license itself) can only be transformed, and allocated terms of works copyleft license. But, partial copyleft license permits allocation of some transformations under terms other than the copyleft license, or do not impose all the principles of copylefting on the work.

 Share-alike copyleft license: Share-alike imposes the necessity that any right that is permitted or granted relating to the original work must be permitted on absolutely the same or adaptable terms in any inherited work. For example, some permutations of Creative Commons Licenses.

 Permissive license: A permissive license refers to a license which permits reuse on much broader terms, including transformation and release in non-open forms. Its purpose is to maximize the use of a piece of software. For example, MIT license.

Most popular Open Source Software (OSS) licenses are Apache license, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license, Mozilla Public License (MPL) and so on.

3.4.2 OSS licensing strategies

After discussing so much about OSS licensing, we will now discuss about OSS licensing strategies which are given below:

 Expansion strategy: It is an open source demonstration of the law of conservation of modularity which says that a single layer of a software stack is "modular and agreeable," permitting adjacent software layers to be "expanded.

 Dual license strategy: In the dual license strategy, a software company provides either free use (it carries some specific conditions) of its software with some constraints, or for a free commercial allocation of rights and a bigger set of characteristics.

 Consulting strategy: As per this strategy, consulting and services are rising as compared to software licenses.

 Patronage strategy: This strategy may be used for transforming a specific layer of the software stack into a commodity, removing competitors that are extracting profit from that layer.

 Hosted strategy: According to this strategy, many software companies like Google, do not sell their software, instead permit you to use it or rent it.

 Embedded strategy: This strategy states that there are many Operating Systems (OS), such as Linux, which are used in many consumer products.

From the discussion, we can analyze that the publishers intensely protect the copyrighted work from unauthorized distribution of copies. In addition, they also protect the creation of derivative works based on the work. For example, in artistic works, the issues of unauthorized distribution of the original work are more common. The illegal derivative work irregularly result in lawsuits or other disputes. However, the price of artistic or aesthetic work depends on their original form of expression, which is non-dynamic.

By comparison, software is both dynamic and functional. Each program contains code that is both dynamic and functional. In dynamic, software can perform those functions in a completely diverse circumstance. In functional, it shows that it does work. Thus, we can understand that each program which is created provides two distinct types of value. The two distinct types of values are:

 Formal purpose as an application or database.

 Possible source of code for use in performing other functions.

When you purchase a piece of software like Microsoft Excel, you get a physical copy of the software and the manual (if it is created). The right to use the software for its intended purpose is to use it as a spreadsheet program. When you open the plastic wrap on the box, then you are bound to the so-called shrink-wrap license. Under this:

 You cannot reproduce the original work (beyond the single copy made for her own use).

 You cannot create derivative works based on the original work.

 You cannot authorize others to do the mentioned two things for you.

The exclusion of these three restrictions is the groundwork of open source licensing.

We need to underatand that a customer of software licensed under an open source license is in an entirely different position. If you are an open soruce customer you can freely share copies of the original work because of the open distribution principle of the license. You can freely modify the original work and share those derivative works with other users, because of the open modification principle of the license. The only considerable restriction upon the customers exercise of these rights is, that an open source license is likely to impose the copies of the work that customer shares. It can be the original work or the derivative work and it must obey the law of the open soruce license.

For example, lets us consider an open source license that imposes a condition saying that you are supposed to share any derivative works of the original work. It also mentions that the act of sharing should also be on the same conditions under which you are allowed to the work under the original license. This suggests that other users who obtain copies of your modified works must themselves be able to redistribute the original work. They should also make derivative works from the original work. This is with subject only to the limitation that they allow others to do the same. This principle is called as generational limitation. This limitation may prevent an open source code from going closed. The limitation also requires that the users and code contributors stand for by the values of open source initiative.

Note: Generational limitation depends on the conditions of the original license.

We need to understand that the open source differs from the process of traditional copyright licensing since, it permits you to modify and distribute the original software as an open soruce software. When using the open source license you will experience substantial improvements over traditional proprietary commercial software licensing models. These improvements happen only when copyright holders make a user-modifiable source code available for programs which they share and permit the distribution and development of derivative works.

3. (a) What is Academic Free License (AFL) ?Explain
Introduction

By now you must be familiar with the provisions of classic open source licenses such as the MIT, BSD, and Apache license. This unit familiarizes you with the concept of Academic Free License (AFL), its provisions and various applications.

We know that many educational institutes use software for learning purposes for example C, C++, Java, and so on. The AFL was developed with the intention to help such educational institutions. This also helped individual students, and teachers to have access to software or source code developed by various well-known research organizations. You as a teacher can improve your teaching skills by knowing more about the software which is available under AFL, and as a student you can enhance the knowledge on particular software available as an open source under the terms of AFL.

You can adopt AFLs for non-commercial purposes for example, in research organizations. Since, such organizations do not get any profit or compensation of any form for the software they develop. You can also make the software developed using the original AFL licensed software in your research organization available as open source software under the terms of AFL.

The AFL software can be used by students or staff members within the educational institution and they do not have to pay for the software they use. That means you do not have to purchase the software since, it is open source. However, you are strictly prohibited from using this software for commercial purpose.

verview of Academic Free Licenses

Now let us begin our discussion with a brief introduction about the origin of AFL. The Academic Free License (AFL) is a free software license created by Lawrence E. Rosen, an attorney and computer specialist, in the year 2002. It has no limits or restrictions on model size. As we briefly discussed in the introduction the Academic free license is generally used by faculty, students or staff of an academic institution. It is also used for research or educational purposes.

The Academic Free License applies to the original work, which is usually a source code and whose licensor has included a provision, referred as a notice, immediately following the copyright notice for the original work.

Academic Free license grants the rights similar to that of BSD, MIT, and Apache licenses. However, it was developed to correct the expected problems with these licenses. As we have already discussed about BSD and MIT license in the previous unit, and you know that all these three licenses are open source free software,



(b) List the features of the AFL
The features of the AFL include:

 It has a patent grant as well as copyright to the software.

 It assures that no trademark rights are approved to the licensor's trademarks.

 It provides an identification of the type of software being licensed by including a notice following the software's copyright notice.

 It guarantees that the licensor owns the copyright.

 It is copyrighted with the rights granted to copy and distribute the software without modification.

 It guarantees that the licensor is distributing the software under a license.

Most of the academic free licenses adopt the short and simple process of BSD model. It deals with the issues of patent, trademark, jurisdictions, and venue in the way similar to that of BSD philosophy of open source. The licensed AFL software can be used in combination with any other software, including proprietary or any derivative works.

The new Academic Free License version 2.0 eliminates the confusion between academic-style licenses and reciprocal public licenses, which include the General Public License (GPL) and other Open Software Licenses (OSL). Reciprocal license states that if you modify the existing and original source code and later choose to distribute the changes in any form then that modified code should be licensed under the same license as the original source code.

Academic free licenses are available to certified educational institutions, which include vocational schools, colleges, and universities. Individual students and teaching staff can also avail these licenses. Academic licenses allow you to access fully-functional version of the software for non-commercial purposes such as education and research.

4.Explain Public code archive
Public code archive

The philosophy behind Open Source Software is simple, and according to that everyone or the public should be able to access the software and use it in any way they want. Therefore, making the code accessible to the public is the most crucial factor of an open source project. Public code archive is one of the important infrastructures needed for an open source project which enables the users to access the software very easily.

The main requirement in an open source project that we need to know is that the source code should be publicly available. Developer, whether inside or outside the company should be able to obtain the latest version of the code at any point of time. Any developer who is responsible for maintaining a module, that is the module owner, should be able to make the necessary changes directly to the source code. The contributions and bug fixes from the developers, who have not yet been granted the write access to the source, have to be integrated into the source code archive in a timely manner. The different module owners and other main developers will do the major tasks involved. The builds of the source codes have to be done frequently and should be available for download by the developers and users. A fairly stable code which is a less recent build is usually made available for download and the users should be able to download a working version of the code at any point of time.

You need to know that the Concurrent Versioning System (CVS) with an open source project archive system is used to maintain the repository of the shared code. This enables multiple developers to edit the source code without touching the changes made by each other. The defining branches are also supported to create multiple versions of the code and also make it possible to roll back to an earlier version. The Source Control Management (SCM) system used in the project should be freely available to the project developers. The same SCM system should be used by the development team members so that, the features lost by using CVS can be made up by working with the outside developers. By this way, the missing features can be added either to CVS or to its replacement subversion. The subversion project is used to build a version control system, which will be a compelling replacement for CVS in the open source community.

For example, Mozilla project uses Bonsai tool, which will let you perform queries on the contents of a CVS archive to determine the recent changes and also the one responsible for changing a specific line of code.


5. What is mutual consent? Explain the two ways by which the parties can attack each other.

6. Write a Note on Forking
Forking

As you are now familiar with models of open source and free software development, so we will move further and discuss about �Forking� which is one of the main concepts in software development.

Forking is a phenomenon that occurs when a software project splits, and both develop into unique software. Therefore, when software is split into two and developed independently then the software are called forked software. They may be compatible, but over a period of time they become highly independent and incompatible. It is a major event in all the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) projects, and very important for the enhancement of the software.

The FOSS can be forked legally. There is no need for the developer to take permission from the license holder to fork the software. It generally occurs when the project splits to achieve different objectives or due to personal clashes between the developers of the community. For example, the Xemacs was forked out of GNU Emacs, and both served two different groups of users. Both the projects were a big hit among the users.

You should note that developing a separate project from the original will not create a fork, but it has to compete with other software of the same kind. However, it is very common to develop and release an experimental version, in a FOSS development process. For example, in a FOSS project many developers get involved in the development process with different approaches, and source codes. Choosing the best code from the available set of codes, and carrying on with the development process is not forking. Instead, developing a new code for serving a different user group from the existing code is considered as forking. For example, a user group, which has developed a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm for Radio Astronomy application, can fork and pursue developing weather forecasting application around the same FFT algorithm as a different group.

However, many open source communities do not encourage splitting of single software, and developing both the software independently. Since, developing similar software independently weakens the user base of the open development process. Forking divides the user and programmer base that contributes to the development. Since, users are very important in open source development, splitting them is not a good idea. The forked open source development might remain same for some period of time. Thus, enabling the users to transfer ideas and bug solutions between each other. Over a period of time, this development project will reach a level, where the projects take different directions. At some point of time both the projects start competing with each other. At this point, getting a solution from the competing project will be very difficult than creating the solution from scratch. In order to avoid this repetition of effort and splitting the community, many organizations do not encourage forking.

The organizations adopted licensing as a tool to prevent such a forking of their software. One has to understand that all open source software is open to forking. This forces the organizations to provide various levels of protection. Organizations which depend on the reputation of the developers, involved in the project to avoid forks, and they also add licensing terms to prevent forks, for example, Apache and Perl licenses. Under GPL licenses, to prevent forks, the developers have to distribute or modify the licensed code according to the open development terms.

The Apache license restricts the usage of the brand name Apache. For example, the Apache license, Version 1.1 and 2.0, restricts the use of the name Apache in any of its modified software packages without permission. Therefore, after making modification to the Apache�s software, as a user you cannot use the names �Apache� and �Apache Software Foundation� for promoting the software. You have to take a written permission from the Apache foundation, if you want to use the name of the organization. With some simple techniques like holding the control over the name, or the license code, and marinating the high standards in software distribution, the Apache Foundation is able to avoid forks.

Following the open development model for its projects under GPL licensed code, the GNU GPL is able to limit forks. Under the GPL, all development projects can freely get separated from each other, and from two different projects. But, each part of the forked project is free to draw the work of the other, fully. This helps to reduce the competition between the two similar projects. This method will not prevent a fork, but instead it makes provision to reunify the forked project.

The open development model is prone to forks, but the nature of the license will help in preventing the negative effect of the fork. The licensing terms and conditions must have a tactical approach in order to limit the effect of the fork. Organizations can also benefit from fork. For achieving this, organizations must allow open access to the source code, and encourage developer and users in the development of forks. Forking enables the process of open source development and in turn, every open source license permits forking. Hence, the open source licenses must regulate forks, but it must not restrict forking.
