(a) What is open source software? List the examples of open source
systems.?

Software is termed as an open source if you can download the software,
access its source code, and modify the source code. However, we have to
ensure that no license requirements are underestimated or overlooked. The
license terms differ drastically from software to software.
Some of the examples of open source systems are:
 Linux: It is a computer operating system and kernel originating as a
UNIX system and existing in many versions.
 Apache: It is a web server program used in most web server computers
and available for Windows as well as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Firefox: It is a web client program existing for Mac and Windows as well
as Linux and other UNIX systems.
 Open office: It is an office application set, compatible with all other
major office application sets such as Microsoft Office and Mac as well as
Linux and other UNIX systems.

Before, we continue with the open source, let us understand the meaning of
closed source, which will give a clear idea about open source.
Closed source generally is not available for any changes. Source code is
not provided to the public. It is developed in an accumulated executable
state and this is what the market is authorised to access. For example,
Apple, the proprietor and developer of Macintosh operating systems, along
with other major software companies, have long been proponents of closed
source business.
On the other hand, open source software licenses are considered to be far
less restrictive in terms of how the software can be used. Fewer restrictions
do not mean that open source licenses will not impose any conditions on
usage.
The organization that opts for open source software will use the software the
way it desires. However, this freedom comes with certain responsibilities.
For example, if open source software users make some modification in the
source code of the software, it would be the users’ responsibility to share
the modifications made, with the actual developer of the product or the
software. It is also the responsibility of users to share the changes with the
user community/forum of the software. This principle enables to form a
network for information exchange and helps in optimising the product.
Open source software is distributed at zero cost and its source code is
available to the users at zero-price.
There are many reasons why open source software offer remarkable
benefits to users. It:
 Encourages innovation. Expensive software forces IT organizations to
purchase software only for proven applications. Lower costs allow
organizations to experiment and develop new applications or lines of
business and achieve greater business advantage.
 Enables IT organizations to minimize their software purchase budget
allocation, which in turn enables organizations to purchase software that
they might not have been able to afford.
 Increases the testability and robustness of the software, making it more
efficient and bug free. Since more users will use the software, they will
be able to find bugs and report them to the company and sometimes
provide possible solution to debug.

(b) What are the common tools required for the development of open
source software?
A program or an application the software developers use to create, debug,
and maintain new application is known as Software Development Tool.
These are small programs that provide a platform to develop the application,
test it and help to maintain it.
Depending on the function and the requirements, various application tools
are available in the market. Each tool has its own specifications and
features. Since these are open source tools, developers prefer to use these
tools to develop open source software.
Some of the common tools required for the development of open source
software are:
 Communication Tool.
 Software Engineering Tool.
 Bug Trackers and Task Lists.
 Testing Tools.
 Package Management.

Communication tool: Communication is an essential part of software
development. Usually developers and users of an open source project may
not be working in the same place. Some electronic means of communication
is required to establish a link between the developer and the user. E-mails
are the most common forms of communication among them. With the help
of an electronic mailing list (list of mail addresses stored in the hardware
memory) you can ensure that the e-mail messages are delivered to all
interested users at once.
Another important tool for communication is instant messaging. This
enables real time communication with the help of the internet. The Internet
Relay Chat (IRC) is an example of real-time internet text messaging or
chatting. It was designed mainly to address the need of group
communication in discussion forums. The most recent addition to electronic
communication is web forums. They have become a common way for users
to troubleshoot problems they encounter when using an open source
product. “Wikis” is one of the most popular web forums, the developers and
the users use.


Software engineering tool: Most of the volunteers who participate in the
development of OSS are distributed in different geographical regions of the
globe. This demands a need for tools to help developers to collaborate in
the development of source code.

Concurrent Versions System (CVS) is one of the prominent source code
collaboration tools used in OSS projects. When several people work on a
project at the same time, this tool helps to manage files and codes of the
project. This is achieved by moving the file into the users’ directories and
then merging the files when the users finish their work. It also enables you
to recover the previous version of a file stored in the directory.
The Subversion revision control system (SVN) is a successor of CVS. This
was developed to replace CVS. Though it is similar to CVS, it supports
some new versions of file formats and is compatible with many operating
systems.

Bug trackers and task lists: A bug tracker is a software application
designed to assist programmers to maintain quality in the design. It allows
the developer to keep track of bugs as and when they are found in the
product. It is also used as Issue Tracking System (ITS).
ITS is a software package that manages and maintains the list of issues in a
structured form, as needed by an organization. Irrespective of the size of the
organization, bug tracking system is very essential for efficient functioning of
a software development project. Some of the popular bug tracker softwares
are Bugzilla, Request tracker, Source Forge, and so on.
Testing tools: Any OSS development project frequently undergoes
integration. Integration is a process of arranging all small software
programmes and creating single software. For achieving efficient
integration, testing tools are used during the system integration for error
detection. Tinderbox is an example of one such testing tool. This tool
enables the developers in an OSS project to detect errors during the
integration of the system. The tool runs a continuous integration process
and informs users about the parts of source code that have problems. It also
provides information about the platform on which this problem has occurred.
The special feature of this tool is its ability to identify the author of the wrong
code during the integration process. Hence, the author is responsible for the 
error that can be traced and resolved. Since normal testing tools are very
expensive, open source testing tools are gaining popularity day by day.
A computer program used to find and reduce faults and errors in other
programs is known as a debugger. GNU Debugger (GDB) is an example of
debugger software used in Open Source Software development. This
debugger offers remote debugging.

For example, you have designed and modified some portion of the software.
A friend of yours who is in another part of the country would be able to
debug the software in your computer from his place. There is no need for
you to have debugging software installed in your computer for debugging
software. This feature makes it a special tool for open source software
development.
Memory leaks and buffer overflows can be detected using a programming
tool called a memory debugger. A memory leak occurs when a computer
program occupies unnecessary system memory. This problem happens
whenever a program fails to release memory that it has occupied after the
execution, which is no longer needed. Mozilla’s XPCOM is an example of
memory leak detection tool.
Package management: A collection of tools to automate the process of
installing, configuring, upgrading, and removing software packages from a
computer is known as Package Management System. The Red Hat
Package Manager (RPM) and Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) are package
management systems used by a number of Linux distributions. These tools
present a uniform way for users to install and remove programs with a single
command.

2. Explain the OSS licensing strategies

Open Source Software Licensing

As we have learnt about contract and copyright in the prevoius section. We will now discuss about open source software licensing, in this section. Before proceeding further we will firstly define, �What is Open Source Software Licensing?�

Open source software (OSS) licensing refers to licensing (granting permission to use intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents, or technology, under defined conditions) the software that is licensed to the users with the rights to execute the program for any reason, to transform the program, to reallocate duplications of either the original or transformed program (without royalties, etc).

Open source licensing is mainly advantageous when you want to prohibit an individual or group of users to completely utilize a work only for their own purpose. It also enables your work to reach a wide audience and also to have some commercial gain from such work. However, creators are required to surrender all the rights granted by copyright to the entities like the users of the work. These entities are capable of using the work of the creator and also distributing it according to the copyright law.

3.4.1 Types of OSS licenses

As we have already discussed about OSS licensing, so we will now discuss about the types of OSS Licenses, 

Types of OSS Licenses

� Copyleft licenses: Copyleft license refers to the license that tries to assure that the public keeps the rights to use, transform, and/or reallocate a creative work and all other works based on it, instead of restricting such rights. This license is used to keep up copyright conditions.

copy left licenses is also divided into different categories, which are as follows:

� Strong/weak copyleft license: �Strong copyleft� license refer to the license which is exercised to all inherited works. For example, GNU General Public License which consists of listing of all terms and conditions for duplicating, transforming, and allocating free software. �Weak copyleft� license refer to the license which is exercised only to the work that is copylefted, not to the remaining elements of the package. For example, Mozilla Public License acts as the controlling licensing for the Mozilla web browser and related software.

� Full/partial copyleft license: Full copyleft license remains when all parts of a work (except the license itself) can only be transformed, and allocated terms of work�s copyleft license. But, partial copyleft license permits allocation of some transformations under terms other than the copyleft license, or do not impose all the principles of copylefting on the work.

� Share-alike copyleft license: Share-alike imposes the necessity that any right that is permitted or granted relating to the original work must be permitted on absolutely the same or adaptable terms in any inherited work. For example, some permutations of Creative Commons Licenses.

� Permissive license: A permissive license refers to a license which permits reuse on much broader terms, including transformation and release in non-open forms. Its purpose is to maximize the use of a piece of software. For example, MIT license.

Most popular Open Source Software (OSS) licenses are Apache license, Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, GNU General Public License (GNU GPL), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license, Mozilla Public License (MPL) and so on.

3.4.2 OSS licensing strategies

After discussing so much about OSS licensing, we will now discuss about OSS licensing strategies which are given below:

� Expansion strategy: It is an open source demonstration of the �law of conservation of modularity� which says that a single layer of a software stack is "modular and agreeable," permitting adjacent software layers to be "expanded�.

� Dual license strategy: In the dual license strategy, a software company provides either free use (it carries some specific conditions) of its software with some constraints, or for a free commercial allocation of rights and a bigger set of characteristics.

� Consulting strategy: As per this strategy, consulting and services are rising as compared to software licenses.

� Patronage strategy: This strategy may be used for transforming a specific layer of the software stack into a commodity, removing competitors that are extracting profit from that layer.

� Hosted strategy: According to this strategy, many software companies like Google, do not sell their software, instead permit you to use it or rent it.

� Embedded strategy: This strategy states that there are many Operating Systems (OS), such as Linux, which are used in many consumer products.

From the discussion, we can analyze that the publishers intensely protect the copyrighted work from unauthorized distribution of copies. In addition, they also protect the creation of derivative works based on the work. For example, in artistic works, the issues of unauthorized distribution of the original work are more common. The illegal derivative work irregularly result in lawsuits or other disputes. However, the price of artistic or aesthetic work depends on their original form of expression, which is non-dynamic.

By comparison, software is both dynamic and functional. Each program contains code that is both dynamic and functional. In dynamic, software can perform those functions in a completely diverse circumstance. In functional, it shows that it does work. Thus, we can understand that each program which is created provides two distinct types of value. The two distinct types of values are:

� Formal purpose as an application or database.

� Possible source of code for use in performing other functions.

When you purchase a piece of software like Microsoft Excel, you get a physical copy of the software and the manual (if it is created). The right to use the software for its intended purpose is to use it as a spreadsheet program. When you open the plastic wrap on the box, then you are bound to the so-called �shrink-wrap license�. Under this:

� You cannot reproduce the original work (beyond the single copy made for her own use).

� You cannot create derivative works based on the original work.

� You cannot authorize others to do the mentioned two things for you.

The exclusion of these three restrictions is the groundwork of open source licensing.

We need to underatand that a customer of software licensed under an open source license is in an entirely different position. If you are an open soruce customer you can freely share copies of the original work because of the open distribution principle of the license. You can freely modify the original work and share those derivative works with other users, because of the open modification principle of the license. The only considerable restriction upon the customer�s exercise of these rights is, that an open source license is likely to impose the copies of the work that customer shares. It can be the original work or the derivative work and it must obey the law of the open soruce license.

For example, lets us consider an open source license that imposes a condition saying that you are supposed to share any derivative works of the original work. It also mentions that the act of sharing should also be on the same conditions under which you are allowed to the work under the original license. This suggests that other users who obtain copies of your modified works must themselves be able to redistribute the original work. They should also make derivative works from the original work. This is with subject only to the limitation that they allow others to do the same. This principle is called as generational limitation. This limitation may prevent an open source code from going closed. The limitation also requires that the users and code contributors stand for by the values of open source initiative.

Note: Generational limitation depends on the conditions of the original license.

We need to understand that the open source differs from the process of traditional copyright licensing since, it permits you to modify and distribute the original software as an open soruce software. When using the open source license you will experience substantial improvements over traditional proprietary commercial software licensing models. These improvements happen only when copyright holders make a user-modifiable source code available for programs which they share and permit the distribution and development of derivative works.
