###1. Explain briefly the various static and dynamic parts of UML.
####Static parts of UML
**Class diagram**
Class diagrams are the most common diagrams used for modeling object
oriented systems. A class diagram shows a set of classes, interfaces, and
collaborations and their relationships. We use class diagrams to illustrate
the static design view of a system. Class diagrams that include active
classes deal with the static process view of a system.

**Object diagram**

An object diagram can be considered to be an instance of a class diagram
which shows a set of objects and their relationships. We use object
diagrams to illustrate data structures, the static snapshots of instances of
the things found in class diagrams. Object diagrams deal with the static
design view or static process view of a system just as the class diagrams,
but from the perspective of a real or prototype cases.

**Component diagram**

In a component diagram we can see a set of components and their
relationships. We use component diagrams to illustrate the static
implementation of view of a system. Component diagrams are related to
class diagrams in which a component is usually mapped to one or more
cases, interfaces or collaborations.

**Deployment diagrams**

A deployment diagram shows a set of nodes and their relationships. We use
deployment diagrams to depict a static view of the run-time configuration of
processing nodes and the components that run on those nodes.
Deployment diagrams are related to component diagrams as a node
normally encloses one or more components.

####Dynamic parts of UML
**Use-case diagram**

A use case diagram shows a set of use cases and actors which is a special
kind of class, and their relationships. It provides an overview of all or a part
of the usage requirements for a system or organization in the form of a
model. We can apply use-case diagrams to show the static use case view of
a system. Use-case diagrams are particularly important in organizing and
modeling the behaviors of a system.

**Sequence diagram**

A sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that lays emphasis on the
time ordering of messages. A sequence diagram shows a set of objects and
the messages sent and received by those objects. The objects are typically
named or are anonymous instances of classes, but may also represent
instances of other things, such as collaborations, components, and nodes.
We use sequence diagrams to show the dynamic view of a system.

**Collaboration diagram**

A collaboration diagram is also an interaction diagram that emphasizes the
structural organization of the objects that send and receive messages. A
collaboration diagram may show a set of objects, links among those objects,
and messages sent and received by those objects. The objects are typically
named or anonymous instances of classes, but may also represent
instances of other things, such as collaborations, components, and nodes.
We use collaboration diagrams to show the dynamic view of a system.

**State diagram**
A state diagram shows a state machine comprising of states, transitions,
events and activities. We use state diagrams to illustrate the dynamic view
of a system. They are especially useful in modeling the behavior of an
interface, class, or collaboration. Statechart diagrams emphasize the event-
ordered behavior of an object, which is especially useful in modeling
reactive systems.

**Activity diagram**
An activity diagram shows the flow from one activity to another within a
system. An activity can show a set of activities, a sequential or branching
flow from activity to activity, and objects that act and are acted upon. We
use activity diagrams to show the dynamic view of a system. Activity
diagrams are especially important in modeling the function of a system as
they highlight the flow of control among objects.
